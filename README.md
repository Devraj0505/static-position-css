# Position-Based CSS (static-position-css)

A tiny static project demonstrating position-based CSS techniques. This repository contains a single page (`index.html`) and a stylesheet (`styles.css`) that show how different CSS positioning properties (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky) affect layout.

## Files

- `index.html` — Example HTML page demonstrating positioned elements.
- `styles.css` — Styles used by `index.html` to illustrate positioning.

## How to view

1. Open the project folder in your file manager or terminal.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (double-click the file or use "Open File" in the browser).

Alternatively, serve the folder with a simple static server (recommended during development):

```bash
# Python 3.x
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Notes

- This is a static, no-build project. No dependencies are required.
- Edit `styles.css` to experiment with different values of `position`, `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`, and `z-index`.
